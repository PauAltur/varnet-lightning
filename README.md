# VarNet Lightning

This repository implements a Variational Network model for MRI reconstruction in PyTorch Lightning. The model is based on the paper [Learning a Variational Network for Reconstruction of Accelerated MRI Data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.26977) by Hammernik et al.

## Getting Started
This project has been implemented in Python X and PyTorch X. In Windows I recommend using [pyenv-win]() to install the appropriate python version and venv to keep the development environment separate from other projects. To get started, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
